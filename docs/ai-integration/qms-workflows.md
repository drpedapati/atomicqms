## CAPA Structure Guidance: Temperature Excursion

I'll help structure your CAPA investigation. Here's a framework:

### Root Cause Analysis (Section 2)

**Investigation Approach:**
Use 5 Whys method for systematic root cause analysis:

```
1. Why did temperature exceed limits?
   ‚Üí Refrigerator compressor failed to cycle properly

2. Why did the compressor fail to cycle?
   ‚Üí [Investigate: Mechanical failure? Control failure? Power?]

3. Why wasn't this caught earlier?
   ‚Üí [Check: Maintenance schedule, previous alerts, logs]

4. Why did it take 45 minutes to discover?
   ‚Üí Alert system worked, but response time review needed

5. Why...
   ‚Üí [Continue based on findings]
```

**Data to Collect:**
- [ ] Refrigerator maintenance logs (last 6 months)
- [ ] Temperature monitoring data (last 30 days)
- [ ] Alert system logs (verify alert timing)
- [ ] Previous temperature deviations
- [ ] Maintenance schedule compliance

### Potential Root Causes to Investigate

**Equipment:**
- Compressor age/service history
- Thermostat calibration status
- Door seal integrity
- Recent maintenance activities

**Process:**
- Maintenance schedule adequacy
- Preventive maintenance execution
- Temperature check frequency
- Alert response procedures

**Human Factors:**
- Staff training on alert response
- Maintenance technician qualifications
- Monitoring system interpretation

### Corrective Actions (Section 3)

**Immediate (Containment):**
- ‚úÖ Samples quarantined
- ‚úÖ Unit taken offline
- ‚úÖ Backup unit activated
- [ ] Sample impact assessment (see below)

**Short-term (Address root cause):**
*After root cause determined, consider:*

If mechanical failure:
- [ ] Repair or replace refrigerator
- [ ] Inspect similar units for signs of failure
- [ ] Review maintenance schedule adequacy

If process failure:
- [ ] Update maintenance SOP
- [ ] Enhance alert response protocol
- [ ] Additional staff training

**Sample Impact Assessment:**
```markdown
## 3.5 Sample Integrity Evaluation

For affected samples (Batch 2025-1020 to 2025-1025):

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Sample type stability data at 12¬∞C
